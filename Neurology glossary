Repetitive stereotyped movements

Strabismus
Misalignment of the eyes

Stupor
Condition of unresponsiveness in which the patient can only be aroused by a noxious stimulus

Subacute
Developing over days to weeks

Subarachnoid space
Space between the pia and arachnoid mater that contains cerebrospinal fluid

Subcortical
Structures located immediately below the cerebral cortex, including the corona radiata, internal capsule, basal ganglia and thalamus

Subdural
A potential space between the dura and arachnoid mater; in health, the arachnoid mater is held against the dura by cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space

Subdural hematoma
Hemorrhage into the subdural space between the dura and arachnoid mater

Substantia gelatinosa
Region of grey matter that caps the apex of the dorsal horn throughout the length of the spinal cord

Sulcus
Groove between two gyri

Suprasellar
Structures located above the sella turcica

Suture
Junction between two bones of the skull

Symptomatic epilepsy
Epilepsy due to an identifiable cause, such as a brain tumor or encephalitis

Syncope
Transient loss of consciousness due to lack of blood flow to the brain, often the result of a cardiac arrhythmia

Syringobulbia
Fluid-filled cavity within the brainstem; may occur as an extension of syringomyelia

Syringomyelia
Central cavitation / fluid-filled structure within the spinal cord parenchyma

t
Tectum
Dorsal aspect of the midbrain containing the rostral and caudal colliculi

Tegmentum
Ventral aspect of the midbrain

Telencephalon
Rostral portion of the prosencephalon consisting of the cerebral hemispheres

Tentorium cerebelli
Fold of dura mater separating the occipital lobes and cerebellum

Tetany
Sustained muscular contraction

Tetraparesis
Weakness in all four limbs

Tetraplegia
Paralysis of all four limbs

Thalamus
Large gray matter structure of the diencephalon that functions as a major relay station between the cerebrum and the brainstem and spinal cord

Titubation
Tremor of the head and neck

Tolerance
Gradual loss of response to a drug (e.g., oral diazepam) with chronic use

Tonic-clonic seizure
Generalized seizure characterized by initial extension of the limbs (tonic phase) followed by rhythmic muscle contractions (clonic phase); a.k.a., grand mal seizure

Tonic seizure
Generalized seizure characterized by stiffening of the entire body

Tonsillar herniation
Herniation of the cerebellar tonsils into the foramen magnum

Torticollis
A form of dystonia characterized by head turn due to involuntary neck muscle contraction

Transient ischemic attack
Transient neurological signs associated with a sudden reduction of blood flow to a particular region of the brain; signs last < 24 hrs; a.k.a., "mini stroke" Transtentorial herniation
Displacement of cerebral tissue (usually temporal or occipital lobe) under the tentorium cerebelli with compression of the brainstem (midbrain)

Transverse myelitis
Inflammatory disorder affecting both sides of the spinal cord causing both motor and sensory deficits

Tremor
Involuntary, rhythmic, alternating contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles

Trismus
Reduced opening of the jaw due to tonic spasm of the masticatory muscles; most often the result of tetanus

Return to top

u
Upper motor neurons
First order neurons that originate in the brain and synapse on interneurons or lower motor neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord

Return to top

v
Ventral
Toward the bottom surface of a standing patient

Ventral horn
Ventral portion of spinal cord gray matter containing motor neurons

Ventricles
Four cerebrospinal fluid-filled cavities within the brain; consists of paired lateral ventricles, third ventricle, and fourth ventricle

Ventriculitis
Inflammation of the ventricles in the brain

Vermis
Median region of the cerebellum

Vertigo
A subjective sense that the external world is moving or spinning

Virchow-Robin space
A perivascular space between an artery and vein and the pia mater

Return to top

w
Wallerian degeneration
Axonal and myelin degeneration that occurs distal to a site of injury

Watershed infarct
An infarct that occurs in “border zones” of the brain that receive blood supply from two major arteries; requires inadequate blood flow from both arteries, most often the result of global hypoperfusion

White matter
The part of the central nervous system containing axons

Return to top

x
Xanthochromia
Yellowish discoloration of the cerebrospinal fluid resulting from lysis of red blood cells following subacute to chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage

Xeromycteria
Extreme dryness of the nasal passage, usually due to denervation of the lateral nasal gland, which is responsible for most of the moisture in the nose. The gland is innervated by parasympathetic fibers of the facial nerve.

Xerostomia
Dry mouth due to decreased salivary secretion
